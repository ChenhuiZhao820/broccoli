## Executive Summary

Deskie is an intelligent recruitment and interview system that transforms how organizations evaluate technical talent. By leveraging advanced AI capabilities, our platform generates customized interview frameworks that adapt to each candidate's background while maintaining consistent evaluation standards. This document provides a comprehensive overview of our product design, user journeys, and the problems we solve from an engineering and product management perspective.

## The Problem Space

Organizations conducting technical interviews face a fundamental challenge: evaluating candidates effectively requires deep domain expertise that hiring managers often lack. Traditional approaches involve either expensive technical consultants or generic assessment tools that fail to capture the nuances of specific roles and company needs. This results in poor hiring decisions, extended time-to-hire, and significant opportunity costs.

Current solutions in the market fall into two categories. Generic AI interview platforms like HireVue provide standardized assessments that treat all software engineering roles identically, missing crucial role-specific competencies. On the other hand, traditional technical interview services require scheduling external experts, creating bottlenecks and adding substantial costs to the hiring process.

## Product Architecture and Design Philosophy

Deskie's architecture reflects a fundamental insight: effective interviews require both standardization for fairness and personalization for relevance. We achieve this through a two-module system that separates the interview design phase from the evaluation phase.

The first module, our Interview Design System, creates what we call a "thought chain" - a comprehensive framework that defines what excellence looks like for a specific role. This isn't just a list of skills, but a nuanced understanding of how different competencies interact and their relative importance. For example, a startup's senior engineer role might weight system design skills differently than an enterprise position, even with identical job titles.

The second module, our Evaluation Engine, applies this framework to assess candidates through personalized questions. Rather than asking every candidate the same questions, our system generates queries that probe their specific experiences while measuring against consistent criteria. This approach respects candidates' time by focusing on relevant areas while ensuring fair comparison across applicants.

## Primary User Personas

Our platform serves three distinct user groups, each with unique needs and workflows.

The Hiring Manager represents our primary user - typically someone responsible for building their team but lacking the technical depth to evaluate specialized skills effectively. Sarah, a product manager at a growing fintech startup, exemplifies this persona. She needs to hire backend engineers who can design scalable payment systems, but her expertise lies in product strategy, not distributed systems architecture. She currently relies on her overworked tech lead to conduct interviews, creating bottlenecks and frustration.

The Technical Recruiter forms our secondary user group. These professionals manage multiple open positions across different technical domains. Marcus, a recruiter at a mid-size technology company, juggles fifteen open engineering positions ranging from mobile developers to data scientists. He struggles to pre-screen candidates effectively, often sending unqualified applicants to hiring managers, damaging his credibility and wasting everyone's time.

The Candidate represents our end user - the person actually experiencing the interview. Chen, a senior frontend engineer with seven years of experience, has grown frustrated with interviews that either ask trivial questions far below his level or abstract puzzles unrelated to the actual job. He wants opportunities to demonstrate his real-world problem-solving abilities and discuss his relevant experience.

## Detailed User Journeys

Understanding how each user interacts with our platform reveals the value we create at each touchpoint.

### The Hiring Manager's Journey

Sarah begins by pasting a job description URL into Deskie. Our system immediately analyzes the posting, extracting not just the explicit requirements but inferring important context. It recognizes that her fintech startup likely values engineers who understand regulatory compliance and can work with legacy banking APIs - insights that might not appear in the job description but are crucial for success.

Within seconds, Deskie presents Sarah with a proposed interview framework. She sees that the system has identified five core competencies: payment systems expertise (weighted at 35%), API design skills (25%), scalability mindset (20%), security consciousness (15%), and collaborative communication (5%). Each competency includes a clear description and example evaluation criteria.

Sarah can adjust these weightings using simple sliders. Perhaps she knows that their immediate challenge is scaling rather than new feature development, so she increases the scalability weighting. The system immediately shows how this change affects the types of questions that will be asked.

Once satisfied, Sarah activates the interview. Candidates begin applying, and she watches their progress through a real-time dashboard. As each candidate completes their interview, she receives a comprehensive evaluation report. The report doesn't just show scores - it explains why a candidate excelled at system design but struggled with security considerations, complete with specific examples from their responses.

The magic happens in the details. Sarah can see that when asked about handling payment failures, one candidate discussed implementing circuit breakers and exponential backoff, while another only mentioned basic retry logic. She doesn't need to understand these concepts deeply because the system explains their significance in plain language: "Circuit breakers prevent cascade failures in distributed systems - this indicates senior-level thinking about system reliability."

### The Recruiter's Journey

Marcus uses Deskie differently. He creates interview templates for common roles, building a library of frameworks that he can deploy quickly. When a new position opens, he selects the closest template and makes minor adjustments based on the specific team's needs.

His workflow centers on the candidate pipeline view. As applications arrive, Deskie automatically initiates the interview process, sending personalized invitations that explain what candidates can expect. Marcus monitors completion rates and can send gentle reminders to candidates who haven't finished.

The system helps Marcus have more meaningful conversations with hiring managers. Instead of vague feedback like "they weren't technical enough," he receives specific insights: "The candidate showed strong theoretical knowledge but limited practical experience with high-scale systems. Their examples all came from academic projects rather than production environments."

### The Candidate's Journey

Chen receives an interview invitation that immediately feels different. Instead of generic instructions, it explains that the interview will focus on his experience with React performance optimization and building design systems - directly relevant to his background.

As he begins the interview, Chen appreciates that questions build on his actual experience. When he mentions working on a design system at his current company, the follow-up question asks about specific challenges he faced with component versioning - a real problem he's solved rather than an abstract puzzle.

The interface respects his time with progress indicators and time suggestions. He can pause and return later if needed. Questions are presented one at a time in a distraction-free environment, allowing him to focus on providing thoughtful responses.

After completing the interview, Chen receives confirmation that his responses were received and a timeline for next steps. He feels the process respected his expertise and gave him fair opportunity to demonstrate his capabilities.

## Technical Innovation and Differentiation

Our platform's effectiveness stems from several technical innovations that create compounding advantages.

The thought chain generation system represents our core intellectual property. Unlike simple keyword matching or generic competency frameworks, our system understands the subtle relationships between skills, experience levels, and organizational contexts. It can infer that a "full-stack engineer" at a 10-person startup needs different skills than one at a large enterprise, even if the job descriptions appear similar.

Our personalization engine goes beyond simple Mad Libs-style question generation. It maintains semantic consistency while adapting to each candidate's background. When generating questions, it considers not just what skills to assess but how to assess them given the candidate's experience level and background. A recent bootcamp graduate and a senior engineer might both be asked about state management, but the depth and framing adapt appropriately.

The evaluation system employs what we call "multi-dimensional relative scoring." Rather than absolute ratings, we compare responses against others for similar roles while accounting for experience levels. This approach provides more meaningful insights - knowing a candidate ranks in the 85th percentile for their experience level is more valuable than an arbitrary score of 7/10.

## User Experience Design Principles

Every design decision in Deskie reflects our commitment to reducing friction while maximizing insight.

We embrace progressive disclosure throughout the interface. Users see only what they need for their current task, with advanced options available but not overwhelming. This principle extends from the initial job setup (paste a URL and go) to the evaluation reports (summary first, details on demand).

The platform maintains context awareness at every step. If a hiring manager typically hires for frontend roles, the system learns their patterns and suggests appropriate defaults. If a candidate mentions specific technologies in their resume, questions incorporate these tools naturally.

We've designed for interruption tolerance, recognizing that our users juggle multiple responsibilities. Every workflow can be paused and resumed without loss of context. Hiring managers can review half the candidates now and return later. Candidates can complete part of an interview during lunch and finish in the evening.

## Success Metrics and Validation

Our platform's effectiveness is measurable through multiple lenses that matter to different stakeholders.

From the hiring manager's perspective, success means making better hires faster. We track time-to-hire reduction, quality of hire (measured through 6-month performance reviews), and hiring manager satisfaction scores. Early pilot users report 50% reduction in time spent on initial interviews while feeling more confident in their decisions.

For recruiters, success translates to improved pipeline efficiency. We measure candidate completion rates, time-to-first-evaluation, and the percentage of candidates that progress to next rounds. Our personalized approach shows 40% higher completion rates compared to generic assessment tools.

Candidates judge success by their experience quality. We track completion times, abandonment rates, and post-interview feedback. Notably, even rejected candidates report feeling the process was fair and relevant to the role - crucial for maintaining employer brand.

## Data and Privacy Considerations

Given the sensitive nature of recruitment data, our architecture embeds privacy and security from the ground up.

All candidate data is encrypted at rest and in transit. We maintain strict data isolation between different organizations. Our AI models process information in real-time without storing personal details in training data. Candidates can request their data deletion at any time, and we provide clear audit trails for compliance requirements.

We've designed the system to minimize data retention. Interview responses are kept only as long as necessary for the hiring decision, with automatic purging based on configurable policies. This approach not only enhances privacy but also ensures compliance with regulations like GDPR and CCPA.

## Platform Evolution and Roadmap

While our MVP focuses on technical interviews for software engineers, the platform architecture supports natural expansion paths.

The immediate roadmap includes extending to adjacent technical roles like data scientists, DevOps engineers, and technical product managers. Each expansion leverages our core thought chain technology while adding domain-specific evaluation criteria.

We're exploring integration capabilities with existing Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) and HR platforms. Rather than replacing these systems, Deskie becomes a specialized component in the broader recruitment stack, handling the technical evaluation aspect while seamlessly passing results to existing workflows.

Future enhancements include collaborative evaluation features, allowing multiple interviewers to contribute to the assessment process while maintaining consistency. We're also investigating how to provide candidates with personalized feedback and growth recommendations, turning the interview process into a developmental opportunity.
