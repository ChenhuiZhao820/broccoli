## 1. Executive Summary

Deskie is an AI-powered recruitment and interview tool designed to transform the hiring process through intelligent automation. The system serves as a virtual recruiter replacement, enabling hiring managers to conduct effective, unbiased, and scalable interviews without requiring field-specific expertise.

### Core Value Proposition

- **Problem**: Recruiters and hiring managers need field-specific knowledge or extra cost to test the competency of applicants effectively
- **Solution**: AI-customized interviews based on job requirements, team characteristics, company culture, and candidate profiles
- **Outcome**: Low-cost, high-efficiency matching with more suitable candidates

## 2. Product Architecture

### 2.1 Module Design

The system is divided into two primary modules:

1. **Question Generation Module**
    
    - Interviewer Agent generates thought chains based on employer inputs
    - Personalized question creation based on candidate resumes
    - Golden standard answer generation with scoring criteria
2. **Evaluation Module**
    
    - Expert Agent evaluation system (initially single agent for MVP)
    - Future: Dual-agent system for hard skills and soft skills assessment
    - Automated scoring and ranking generation
