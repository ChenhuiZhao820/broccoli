## What is the problem/opportunity you have identified?

Hiring is slow, expensive, and biased. 50% of hires fail within 18 months (Gallup), costing $4K per bad hire (ERE Media), while 60% of recruiters admit bias skews decisions (Harvard Business Review). The $2.8B recruitment tech market (Statista) lacks end-to-end AI tools that combine CV analysis, dynamic interviewing, and auditable scoring—especially for high-volume roles like developers (40M+ global job shortages, IDC). Companies now face regulatory pressure (EU AI Act) to eliminate bias, creating urgent demand for transparent AI solutions.

## What is your proposed solution?

Deskie addresses these challenges through an end-to-end AI recruitment platform that automates and optimizes the entire hiring workflow. Our system begins by intelligently analyzing job descriptions and company culture requirements to establish precise evaluation criteria. It then processes candidate materials to generate personalized interview questions that dynamically adapt based on responses, mimicking human intuition while eliminating subjectivity. Finally, candidates are scored across metrics and ranked using transparent algorithms that comply with emerging AI regulations. Managers & Hirers can then conduct final round interviews knowing there candidates are technically competent for the job role. Unlike existing solutions that focus on discrete parts of the process, Deskie provides the first fully integrated platform that combines smart screening, adaptive interviewing and bias-free evaluation.

## Tell us about your prototype

We've developed user journey mockups and conducted extensive feedback sessions with industry leaders including the COO of Infosas. Currently, we've completed a fully functioning MVP specifically designed for machine learning engineer roles. We're now gathering critical user feedback on this MVP before developing our next iteration, which will expand the system's capabilities to cover all coding-related roles. This phased approach ensures we perfect the technology for one complex technical role before scaling the solution across the programming hiring landscape.

## Tell us about your target customers and the size of your potential market

Our initial target customers are technology startups and growth-stage companies in the UK, particularly those struggling with high-volume technical hiring - a segment comprising approximately 30,000 firms that collectively hire 250,000 developers annually while spending £3 billion on recruitment fees (Burning Glass). These organizations face acute pressure to scale their engineering teams quickly while maintaining hiring quality, making them ideal early adopters for our solution. The total addressable market expands significantly when considering broader applications across all professional hiring - the global recruitment software market currently valued at $2.8 billion (Statista) and growing at 12% annually as more organizations digitize their HR processes. Longer term, regulatory trends mandating transparent hiring practices will drive adoption across enterprise clients and regulated industries.

## Who are your current or anticipated main competitors?

Our primary competitors fall into three categories: legacy applicant tracking systems like Workday that focus on workflow management without intelligent screening capabilities; basic AI screening tools like HireVue that offer static video interviews but lack dynamic adaptation; and traditional recruitment agencies like Hays that rely on human consultants at premium prices. While these solutions address aspects of the hiring challenge, none provide the complete, intelligent workflow that Deskie offers. Crucially, existing tools fail to combine deep candidate assessment with real-time adaptation and transparent scoring - leaving organizations to patch together multiple incomplete solutions while still struggling with inefficiency and bias. The market lacks truly integrated platforms that can replace human intuition with AI-powered precision throughout the entire recruitment lifecycle.
